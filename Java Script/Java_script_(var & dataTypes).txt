	"typeof" is a keyword which is used to check the type of the variable

> We can assign whole function as a value to the variable
	- In order to access the value we can call the variable name
	- in order to access the function we have to use the variable name with() 
		ex: variableName()
		
		ex: let cost = ()=>{
							return 10;
						}
			when we call console.log(cost)  output : {
														return 10;
													 }
			when we call cost() 			output: 10

> annonymous functions is a function without a name and can be used to initialize the variabes

> callback function : function which is passed as an argument for another function , to achieve asynchronous behaviour 

>setTimeout function : is a function which is used to delay the call back function to achieve the asynchronous
